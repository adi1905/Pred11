# Pred11
Pred 11 is Cricket Analysis and Anaytics Project deployed on Power BI. Performed web scraping where I scraped Cricket data from ESPNCricinfo website and used that data to build dashboards.
Also created a ML model which takes two teams, ground name, toss winner and toss decision as inputs and outputs the winning percnetage for both the teams.For this we used a MultiOutputRegressor model.
